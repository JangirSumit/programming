CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a pattern in which the read and write operations are handled separately to optimize the performance, scalability, and flexibility of an application. The Mediator pattern, on the other hand, is used to reduce the dependencies between objects by introducing a mediator object that handles the communication between them. When combined, CQRS with Mediator can be a powerful approach to designing complex systems.

### Overview of CQRS

- **Command Side**: Handles the operations that change the state of the application (writes). Commands are typically processed synchronously.
- **Query Side**: Handles the operations that read the state of the application (reads). Queries can be optimized for reading, and the data model can differ from the command side.

### Overview of Mediator Pattern

- The Mediator pattern involves a central mediator object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- Objects no longer communicate directly with each other; instead, they send messages to the mediator, which then handles the communication.

### Benefits of Combining CQRS with Mediator

- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating reads and writes, and using a mediator to handle interactions, the codebase becomes more modular and easier to maintain.
- **Scalability**: Both reads and writes can be scaled independently. This is particularly useful in high-traffic applications.
- **Flexibility**: Different data models can be used for reading and writing, allowing for more optimization opportunities.

### Implementing CQRS with Mediator in C#

Here's an example of how to implement CQRS with the Mediator pattern in C# using the MediatR library:

1. **Install MediatR**:
   ```shell
   dotnet add package MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
   ```

2. **Define Commands and Queries**:
   ```csharp
   // Command
   public class CreateOrderCommand : IRequest<int>
   {
       public string ProductName { get; set; }
       public int Quantity { get; set; }
   }

   // Query
   public class GetOrderByIdQuery : IRequest<Order>
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Handlers**:
   ```csharp
   public class CreateOrderCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateOrderCommand, int>
   {
       private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;

       public CreateOrderCommandHandler(IOrderRepository orderRepository)
       {
           _orderRepository = orderRepository;
       }

       public async Task<int> Handle(CreateOrderCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
       {
           var order = new Order { ProductName = request.ProductName, Quantity = request.Quantity };
           await _orderRepository.AddOrderAsync(order);
           return order.Id;
       }
   }

   public class GetOrderByIdQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetOrderByIdQuery, Order>
   {
       private readonly IOrderRepository _orderRepository;

       public GetOrderByIdQueryHandler(IOrderRepository orderRepository)
       {
           _orderRepository = orderRepository;
       }

       public async Task<Order> Handle(GetOrderByIdQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
       {
           return await _orderRepository.GetOrderByIdAsync(request.Id);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Register MediatR in DI Container**:
   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddMediatR(typeof(Startup));
       services.AddScoped<IOrderRepository, OrderRepository>();
   }
   ```

5. **Use MediatR in Controller**:
   ```csharp
   [ApiController]
   [Route("api/[controller]")]
   public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
   {
       private readonly IMediator _mediator;

       public OrdersController(IMediator mediator)
       {
           _mediator = mediator;
       }

       [HttpPost]
       public async Task<IActionResult> CreateOrder(CreateOrderCommand command)
       {
           var orderId = await _mediator.Send(command);
           return Ok(orderId);
       }

       [HttpGet("{id}")]
       public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrderById(int id)
       {
           var order = await _mediator.Send(new GetOrderByIdQuery { Id = id });
           return Ok(order);
       }
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

Combining CQRS with the Mediator pattern allows for a clean separation of concerns, improved scalability, and greater flexibility in your application architecture. By leveraging libraries like MediatR, the implementation becomes straightforward, helping to keep your codebase maintainable and extensible.
