Sure! Design patterns are typically divided into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Here’s the list of important design patterns categorized accordingly:

### Creational Patterns

1. **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
3. **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
4. **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
5. **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### Structural Patterns

1. **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.
2. **Bridge**: Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
3. **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
4. **Decorator**: Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
5. **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
6. **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing common parts of their state.
7. **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Behavioral Patterns

1. **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without coupling the sender to the receiver.
2. **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
3. **Interpreter**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
4. **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
5. **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly.
6. **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.
7. **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
8. **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if the object changed its class.
9. **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
10. **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses without changing the algorithm’s structure.
11. **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

These categories help in understanding the purpose and usage of each pattern, making it easier to choose the right pattern for a given problem.
