`React.memo` is a higher-order component (HOC) in React used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of a component. It works by memoizing the component and only re-rendering it if its props change.

---

### When to Use `React.memo`
Use `React.memo` for functional components that:

1. **Rely only on props** for rendering.
2. Are **re-rendering unnecessarily** even when their props haven't changed.
3. **Don't manage internal state** or rely on `useContext` (since `React.memo` doesn't optimize for context changes).

---

### Basic Syntax

```tsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = React.memo(({ value }: { value: string }) => {
  console.log("Rendered MyComponent");
  return <div>{value}</div>;
});
```

- **Without `React.memo`**: The component re-renders every time its parent re-renders, even if `value` doesn't change.
- **With `React.memo`**: The component skips re-rendering unless the `value` prop changes.

---

### Example 1: Simple Optimization

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

const ChildComponent = React.memo(({ value }: { value: string }) => {
  console.log("ChildComponent rendered");
  return <p>Value: {value}</p>;
});

const ParentComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Hello");

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={() => setValue("Updated!")}>Change Value</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <ChildComponent value={value} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- **Output**: 
  - Clicking "Increment Count" does **not** re-render `ChildComponent` because its props (`value`) have not changed.
  - Clicking "Change Value" re-renders `ChildComponent` because `value` changes.

### Example 2: Custom Comparison with `React.memo`

By default, `React.memo` performs a **shallow comparison** of props. For more complex comparisons, you can pass a custom comparison function.

```tsx
const ChildComponent = React.memo(
  ({ user }: { user: { name: string; age: number } }) => {
    console.log("ChildComponent rendered");
    return (
      <p>
        {user.name} - {user.age}
      </p>
    );
  },
  (prevProps, nextProps) => {
    // Compare deep object equality
    return prevProps.user.name === nextProps.user.name &&
           prevProps.user.age === nextProps.user.age;
  }
);
```

In this example, the `user` object is deeply compared, avoiding re-renders unless its properties change.

---

### Caveats and Notes

1. **Shallow Comparison**: By default, `React.memo` only checks for shallow equality. For complex props (like objects or arrays), it might not behave as expected unless you use a custom comparison.
   
2. **State and Context**:
   - Internal state changes in the component are not optimized by `React.memo`.
   - Changes to context values will cause a re-render even if props are the same.

3. **Performance Cost**: Overusing `React.memo` can sometimes degrade performance due to the cost of comparing props. Use it selectively for components that are costly to re-render.

---

### When Not to Use `React.memo`

1. **Components that re-render quickly**: If the component is simple and lightweight, the cost of memoization might outweigh its benefits.
2. **Dynamic props**: If the props frequently change, `React.memo` might not provide significant optimization.
3. **Use with Context carefully**: It might not optimize components consuming context values.

---

### Advanced Example with Context and React.memo

```tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

const CountContext = createContext(0);

const DisplayCount = React.memo(() => {
  const count = useContext(CountContext);
  console.log("DisplayCount rendered");
  return <p>Count: {count}</p>;
});

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={count}>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Type something"
      />
      <DisplayCount />
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

In this example:
- `DisplayCount` re-renders only when the `CountContext` value changes.
- Typing in the input doesn't cause `DisplayCount` to re-render because it's optimized with `React.memo`.

---

### Summary

- **`React.memo` is great for preventing unnecessary re-renders** in function components, especially those with stable props.
- Use it sparingly and selectively, focusing on components that are re-rendering too often and causing performance issues.
- For dynamic props like objects or arrays, consider using a custom comparison function.
