A **.NET Minimal API** is a lightweight, simplified approach introduced in .NET 6 for building APIs with minimal boilerplate code compared to traditional ASP.NET Core projects. It focuses on simplicity and productivity, making it easier to create APIs with fewer files and configuration.

### **Key Features of Minimal APIs**
1. **Minimal Boilerplate Code**: Requires only `Program.cs` and avoids unnecessary scaffolding.
2. **Lightweight**: Designed for small to medium-sized APIs or microservices.
3. **Top-Level Statements**: Uses C# top-level statements in `Program.cs` to define the entire application.
4. **Simplified Routing**: Uses concise methods like `MapGet`, `MapPost`, etc., for routing.
5. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Fully supports DI, similar to traditional ASP.NET Core applications.
6. **OpenAPI/Swagger Support**: Comes with built-in support for generating OpenAPI documentation using Swashbuckle or NSwag.

### **Creating a Minimal API**
Here’s how to create a simple .NET Minimal API:

#### 1. **Set Up a Project**
Create a new minimal API project:
```bash
dotnet new web -o MinimalApiDemo
```

#### 2. **Edit `Program.cs`**
Below is an example of a `Program.cs` file for a Minimal API:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Map routes
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello, World!");  // A simple GET endpoint
app.MapGet("/hello/{name}", (string name) => $"Hello, {name}!");

app.MapPost("/create", (User user) => 
{
    return Results.Ok($"User {user.Name} created successfully!");
});

// Start the app
app.Run();

// A simple model
public record User(int Id, string Name);
```

### **Key Components Explained**

1. **Routing**:
   - Routes are defined with methods like `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapPut`, and `MapDelete`.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     app.MapGet("/api/{id}", (int id) => $"ID: {id}");
     ```

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   Services can be added in the `builder.Services` collection, just like traditional ASP.NET Core apps.
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
   app.MapGet("/service", (IMyService service) => service.DoSomething());
   ```

3. **Middleware**:
   Middleware can still be added to the pipeline:
   ```csharp
   app.Use(async (context, next) =>
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Middleware executed!");
       await next();
   });
   ```

4. **Swagger/OpenAPI**:
   Add Swagger for API documentation:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
   builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

   app.UseSwagger();
   app.UseSwaggerUI();
   ```

5. **Request and Response Handling**:
   Minimal APIs support binding from request bodies, query strings, and headers directly to parameters.

### **When to Use Minimal APIs**
**Ideal for**:
- Small APIs or microservices.
- Prototypes or proof-of-concept applications.
- Applications that don’t require advanced MVC features (e.g., filters, controllers, or views).

**Not ideal for**:
- Complex applications requiring advanced routing or MVC patterns.
- Applications with many cross-cutting concerns (filters, model binding, etc.).

---

### **Advanced Topics**
1. **Middleware Configuration**:
   Middleware like authentication and CORS can be added:
   ```csharp
   app.UseCors(policy => policy.AllowAnyOrigin());
   app.UseAuthentication();
   app.UseAuthorization();
   ```

2. **Error Handling**:
   Use `.UseExceptionHandler()` or write custom middleware for error handling:
   ```csharp
   app.UseExceptionHandler("/error");
   app.Map("/error", () => Results.Problem("An error occurred."));
   ```

3. **File Uploads**:
   Handle file uploads with Minimal APIs:
   ```csharp
   app.MapPost("/upload", async (IFormFile file) =>
   {
       using var stream = new FileStream($"uploads/{file.FileName}", FileMode.Create);
       await file.CopyToAsync(stream);
       return Results.Ok($"File {file.FileName} uploaded successfully.");
   });
   ```

4. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   Add authentication and protect endpoints:
   ```csharp
   builder.Services.AddAuthentication("Bearer")
       .AddJwtBearer("Bearer", options =>
       {
           options.Authority = "https://example.com";
           options.Audience = "api";
       });

   app.UseAuthentication();
   app.UseAuthorization();

   app.MapGet("/secure", [Authorize] () => "Secure endpoint");
   ```

### **Advantages of Minimal APIs**
- **Concise and Readable**: Less code makes it easier to read and maintain.
- **Performance**: Designed for minimal overhead.
- **Developer Productivity**: Fast to develop small, focused APIs.

### **Disadvantages**
- **Limited Features**: No built-in support for views or controllers.
- **Scalability Concerns**: Can become messy for large applications.
- **Steeper Learning Curve**: Developers familiar with MVC may need to adapt.

### **Comparison: Minimal APIs vs. MVC**
| Feature            | Minimal APIs                     | MVC                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Boilerplate**    | Minimal                         | Requires more boilerplate    |
| **Flexibility**    | Simple and lightweight          | Supports advanced features   |
| **Best For**       | Small to medium APIs            | Large and complex applications |
| **Routing**        | Fluent routing via methods      | Attribute and conventional   |
