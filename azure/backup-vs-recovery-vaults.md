In Azure, **Backup Vault** and **Recovery Services Vault** are both used to manage backups, but they serve slightly different purposes and are optimized for different scenarios.

### 1. **Backup Vault**
- **Purpose**: The **Backup Vault** is a newer Azure resource specifically designed for **Azure Backup Center**, which is a centralized platform for managing and monitoring backups. It is mainly used for **modern workloads** like Azure Virtual Machines, SQL databases, and SAP HANA databases.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Azure Virtual Machines (using Azure Backup).
  - Azure Database workloads (e.g., Azure SQL, SAP HANA).
  - Centralized backup management using Azure Backup Center.
- **Features**:
  - Optimized for **performance** and **scalability**.
  - Enhanced **data protection and recovery** for specific Azure workloads.
  - Supports **soft delete**, which retains backups for a limited time after they are deleted to protect against accidental deletions.

### 2. **Recovery Services Vault**
- **Purpose**: The **Recovery Services Vault** is the older, more **versatile** solution used for both **Azure Backup** and **Azure Site Recovery** (ASR). It supports a **broader range of workloads**, including on-premises servers.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Azure Virtual Machines and on-premises machines (using Azure Backup).
  - Azure Site Recovery for **disaster recovery** and **replication**.
  - Backing up **Azure Files**, **SQL databases**, and **SAP workloads**.
- **Features**:
  - Supports both **Azure Backup** and **Azure Site Recovery** in a single vault.
  - Provides **cross-region disaster recovery** with Site Recovery.
  - Includes features like **instant restore**, **soft delete**, and **multi-user authorization**.

### **Key Differences Between Backup Vault and Recovery Services Vault**

| Feature                          | **Backup Vault**                        | **Recovery Services Vault**            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                      | Optimized for Azure Backup Center       | Supports Azure Backup and Site Recovery |
| **Workloads Supported**          | Azure VMs, Azure SQL, SAP HANA          | Azure VMs, on-premises machines, Azure Files, Azure SQL, SAP HANA |
| **Disaster Recovery**            | Not supported                           | Supports Azure Site Recovery           |
| **Scalability**                  | Higher scalability and performance      | Versatile but not as optimized for scalability |
| **Data Protection**              | Modern features like soft delete        | Soft delete, multi-user authorization  |
| **Centralized Management**       | Integrated with Azure Backup Center     | Managed independently                  |

### **Which One Should You Use?**
- **Use Backup Vault** if you are leveraging the new **Azure Backup Center** for centralized backup management and are only focused on protecting Azure-based resources (like VMs and databases).
- **Use Recovery Services Vault** if you need a more **comprehensive solution** that includes both backups and disaster recovery capabilities, especially if you have **hybrid workloads** (both Azure and on-premises) or need Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery.

Azure is gradually encouraging the use of **Backup Vaults** for newer workloads due to their optimized performance and scalability. However, the **Recovery Services Vault** remains the go-to option if you have broader disaster recovery needs or if you are already using it for existing workloads.
