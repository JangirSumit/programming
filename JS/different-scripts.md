The `async`, `defer`, and default behavior of the `<script>` tag affect **how and when JavaScript is loaded and executed** in relation to the HTML parsing process. Here's the difference:

---

### 1. **`<script>` Without `async` or `defer` (Default Behavior)**
- **Loading:** The browser stops parsing the HTML document and loads the script file immediately.
- **Execution:** The script is executed as soon as it is downloaded, **before continuing to parse the rest of the HTML**.
- **Effect:** This can delay the rendering of the page if the script takes time to download or execute.
  
#### Use Case:
- When the script depends on the exact placement in the HTML (e.g., inline code that interacts with the current DOM state).

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

---

### 2. **`<script async>`**
- **Loading:** The script is loaded in parallel (asynchronously) with the HTML parsing.
- **Execution:** Once the script is downloaded, it is executed **immediately**, pausing HTML parsing.
- **Effect:** Scripts are executed as soon as they are ready, and the order of execution **may vary** (not guaranteed to follow the order in the HTML).

#### Use Case:
- Suitable for scripts that do not depend on each other or the DOM (e.g., analytics or tracking scripts).

```html
<script src="script.js" async></script>
```

---

### 3. **`<script defer>`**
- **Loading:** The script is loaded in parallel (like `async`) with HTML parsing.
- **Execution:** The script is executed only after the entire HTML document is parsed and the DOM is fully built.
- **Effect:** Scripts are guaranteed to execute in the order they appear in the HTML.

#### Use Case:
- For scripts that manipulate the DOM or rely on the full DOM being ready.

```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

### Key Differences:
| **Behavior**         | **Default `<script>`**            | **`async`**                   | **`defer`**                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Loading**           | Blocks HTML parsing              | Parallel to HTML parsing      | Parallel to HTML parsing       |
| **Execution**         | Immediately after download       | Immediately after download    | After HTML parsing finishes    |
| **Order of Execution**| In order of appearance           | No guarantee (depends on load time) | Guaranteed order (as per appearance) |
| **Use Case**          | Scripts dependent on placement   | Independent scripts (analytics, ads) | DOM-dependent scripts          |

### Visual Example of Behavior:
Given the following code:
```html
<script src="a.js"></script>
<script src="b.js" async></script>
<script src="c.js" defer></script>
<script src="d.js"></script>
```

1. **Execution Order:**
   - `a.js`: Executes first, blocking HTML parsing.
   - `d.js`: Executes second, also blocking HTML parsing.
   - `b.js`: Executes as soon as it's downloaded (order not guaranteed).
   - `c.js`: Executes last, after the DOM is fully parsed.

---

### Practical Advice:
- **Use `defer`** for scripts that manipulate the DOM or rely on the full page being parsed.
- **Use `async`** for independent scripts that donâ€™t depend on the DOM or other scripts.
- Avoid the default `<script>` unless absolutely necessary (e.g., inline scripts).
